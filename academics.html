	<p>I started the school year at MHS, but in the second semester, I transfered back to PHS. They work load at PHS is a lot compared to at MHS so its been a little hard to adjust. I made a lot of new friends when I was at MHS and the atmosphere there is different from the atmosphere at PHS. At MHS everyone knows eachother because it is a small school, so people will say hi to you in the halls. I really enjoyed my marine bio class because I had friends in my class and because of all the field trips. </p>
